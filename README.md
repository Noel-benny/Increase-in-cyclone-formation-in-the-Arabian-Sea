Increase in cyclone formation in the Arabian Sea

ABSTRACT:
The destructive potential of tropical cyclones (TCs) in reaction to global warming is an unanswered question. Previous studies have overlooked the impact of TC size change in the context of global warming, resulting in a considerable underestimation of TC destructive potential. The lack of reliable and consistent historical data on TC size makes it difficult to make a confident estimate of the relationship between the observed trend in TC size and the trend in sea surface temperature (SST) against the backdrop of global climate change.
The current study employs a linear regression model to evaluate the reaction of TC size and destructive potential to increases in SST from the year 1891 to 2020. Since 2001, researchers have seen a 52 percent increase in storms in the Arabian Sea, which has transformed into an ideal ocean basin for the development of cyclones. Furthermore, cyclones in the Arabian Sea have been observed to move more slowly, absorbing as much energy as possible when at sea before transforming into severe-intensity storms when they reach the coast.

INTRODUCTION:
The northern Indian ocean consists of two seas: the Bay of Bengal to the east and the Arabian Sea to the west. Tropical Cyclones which form at the north of the equator over the ocean, covering either side of the Indian sub-continent that's the Bay of Bengal, and therefore the Arabian Sea are termed North Indian Ocean (NIO) tropical cyclones. Historically, tropical cyclone activity within the Bay of Bengal is usually more than that of the Arabian Sea.
But the new research showed a shift during this trend. In recent years the frequency of cyclones over the Arabian Sea has also begun to increase. History reveals that the NIO basin has two cyclogenesis favoring seasons per year. One is from April–to May (pre-monsoon season) and the other is from October–to December (post-monsoon season).
It is understood that the evolution of the intensity of cyclones generally depends on the initial intensity of the storm, the thermodynamic profiles of the atmosphere, and also the thermal structure of the upper ocean through which it propagates. Cyclones are characterized by their devastating potential to break structures, the foremost fatalities come from storm surges and also torrential rain flooding the lowland areas of coastal territories.
